# Contributing to Comptroller

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Comptroller. We are actively looking for passionate developers to help take Comptroller to the next level!

Comptroller is an open source project intended to help in designing and managing other open source projects. As such we are excited to get any input from developers on how we can best make this project work for you and every user.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, we will reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.


# Rules and Regulations

> "Rules are meant to be broken." - Someone Somewhere

### Pull requests

While we will never turn away your contribution prima facie, following these guildelines will help to ensure that your contributions are addressed quickly and effectively.

- Comptroller is (supposed to be) platform agnostic; we strive for it to just work everywhere. As such, please be sure to not submit platform specific code. If you do, and feel there is a valid reason for doing so, please tell us why.
- Please ensure that all tests are passing before submitting your pull request. While our CI tools will run tests as well, it's just nice to know that you care that your code works. :wink:
- If you add new features, please add respective tests for them. We're big fans of keeping our badges green. :green_heart:


### Issues

As much fun as debugging can be, we prefer to spend our time building. By providing as much information as you can, you can help everyone spend more time doing what we love rather than sitting here staring at stack traces (and growing neckbeards :neckbeard: for those of us that can). The basics of what would be useful are:

- A description of what you expect to happen and what does happen.
- Steps to reproduce the problem.
- Your configuration and affected source files. If possible a link to the repo/commitish would help tremendously.
- Any stack traces that Comptroller spits out. (If you get an uncaught promise rejection error, we're really very sorry :cry:).


# Getting Started

> There's no wrong way to eat a Reese's, but some ways are better than others.

Because Comptroller is developed through GitHub, we like to take advantage of all of the useful features therein. Because of this, we have some recommended steps to help you get your code merged as seamlessly as possible.

1. Create your own fork of Comptroller. Take good care of it (or don't, it doesn't really matter).
2. Create a branch with a descriptive name. This makes it easier when it comes time to merge.
3. Hack, test, commit, rinse and repeat.
4. Push your changes to your fork (hopefully you've been taking care of it, we like happy forks).
5. Submit your pull request and provide an at least slightly more than lacking description of what your pull request does.
6. Wait for someone to have look.
